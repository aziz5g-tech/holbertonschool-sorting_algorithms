This repository contains my solutions for the Sorting Algorithms project at Holberton School. 
It includes implementations of various sorting algorithms in C, such as Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Quick sort, and Merge sort. 
The project also explores time complexity analysis, algorithm stability, and performance comparison between different sorting techniques.
